# OWASP-Top-10-2021-
A summary of each entry of OWASP Top 10 (2021) with relevant Portswigger links

I created this to help anyone interested in having a single page for each vulnerability on the list, important sub-topics of each entry, and important details to be cohesive in the learning process towards Web Application PenTesting.
Each entry assumes a fundamental understanding of BurpSuite, and contains data from the relevant Portswigger rooms, and within each you can find:
- What is the vulnerability
- The CIA impact
- Where to test for the vulnerability
- Common payloads/tricks
- How to identify the vulnerability
- Mitigations for the vulnerability
- Potential cheat cheets/references
